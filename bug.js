This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and attempting to retrieve data that doesn't exist.  It throws a TypeError because `AsyncStorage.getItem()` returns a Promise that resolves to null if the key is not found, and trying to access a property of null (like `.then` or `.catch`) causes this error.  This often happens when your app assumes data always exists when it might not, especially after a fresh install or when a key is deleted unexpectedly.
